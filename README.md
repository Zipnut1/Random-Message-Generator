# Random-Message-Generator
10 messages were placed in 10 variables then those variables were placed in an array.
Two Methods were created, one to generate a random number to faciliate the program selecting a random message from the array and the other method was used to display the messages that were selected.
This link was used to remind me how to create a random number.https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_random.asp
In the Message function, three variables were created to store a random number then those variables were called to access the element in the array.
